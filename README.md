# NATS PHP Client

A PHP implementation of a client for [NATS](https://nats.io/).

Plase note that this package is currently under development and not ready for general use yet. 

## Usage

Install the package using composer:

```
composer require flownative/nats
```

In PHP, open a new connection with

```php
use Flownative\Nats\Connection;

// Connect to a server
$connection = new Connection(
    'nats://localhost:4222',
    [
        'username' => 'nats',
        'password' => 'password',
        'debug' => true
    ]
);

// Simple publisher
$connection->publish('foo', 'Hello World');

// Simple asynchronous subscriber
$connection->subscribe('foo', function($message) {
    printf("Received a message: %s\n", $message->getData());
});

```

This will open a new socket connection and send a CONNECT and PING to the given NATS server:

```
 ðŸš€  Connecting with server via nats://localhost:4222 ...
>>>> CONNECT {"lang":"php","version":"dev-master@7dd6908c3e9f26e1094873a510547cd950bcb2c7","verbose":false,"pedantic":false,"user":"nats","pass":"password"}
<<<< INFO {"server_id":"MKfYbh2u0ZDgZrI5B1UaAv","version":"1.4.1","proto":1,"git_commit":"3e64f0b","go":"go1.11.5","host":"0.0.0.0","port":4222,"auth_required":true,"max_payload":1048576,"client_id":69} 
>>>> PING
